# Blockchain
A basic implementation of a Blockchain written in Python . This project simulates the core principles of blockchain technology including blocks, hashing, linking, and consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, DPoS).
 Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology used to store data across multiple systems securely and immutably. 
 This project demonstrates how:
- Blocks are linked with hashes
- Data integrity is preserved
- Consensus is reached using various algorithms
- Tampering breaks the chain without recomputation

Features:
- 🧩 Block structure with index, timestamp, data, previous hash, hash, and nonce
- 🔐 SHA-256 cryptographic hashing
- 🔗 Blockchain linking through previous hashes
- ⛏️ Proof of Work (PoW) consensus simulation
- 💰 Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus simulation
- 🗳️ Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) simulation
- 🛠️ Tampering detection via hash mismatch
- 📊 Visual/block info output

This repo is ideal for students, developers, and researchers wanting to understand blockchain fundamentals without dealing with enterprise-scale complexity.
